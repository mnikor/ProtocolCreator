Areas Needing Enhancement

Statistical Analysis Section (Priority: High)

markdownCopy# Current Issues:
- Too general on analysis methods
- Missing specific guidance on handling missing data
- Lacks detail on interim analyses

# Suggested Enhancement:
Generate a Statistical Analysis Plan including:

1. **Analysis Populations**:
   - Define ITT, PP, and safety populations precisely
   - Specify handling of protocol deviations
   - Detail criteria for analysis set assignment

2. **Primary Analysis**:
   - Specify exact statistical tests and models
   - Define significance levels and confidence intervals
   - Detail covariates and stratification factors
   - Specify software and versions to be used

3. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - Define specific imputation methods
   - Detail sensitivity analyses
   - Specify handling of dropouts

4. **Interim Analyses** (if applicable):
   - Define stopping rules
   - Specify alpha spending approach
   - Detail DSMB review process

Study Design Section (Priority: High)

markdownCopy# Current Issues:
- Lacks detail on specific design elements
- Missing timeline specifications
- Insufficient operational details

# Suggested Enhancement:
Detail the Study Design including:

1. **Design Specifications**:
   - Study phase and type
   - Number of arms/groups
   - Allocation ratio
   - Stratification factors
   - Duration of each study period

2. **Visit Schedule**:
   - Screening period duration
   - Treatment period specifications
   - Follow-up requirements
   - Visit windows
   - Permitted deviations

3. **Operational Flow**:
   - Subject registration process
   - Randomization mechanics
   - Drug dispensing procedures
   - Sample handling requirements

Safety Section (Priority: High)

markdownCopy# Current Issues:
- Too general on safety monitoring
- Missing specific AE definitions
- Lacks detail on reporting timelines

# Suggested Enhancement:
Detail Safety Monitoring including:

1. **Adverse Event Management**:
   - Specific AE definitions and grading
   - Reporting timelines and procedures
   - Causality assessment criteria
   - Follow-up requirements

2. **Safety Review Process**:
   - DSMB composition and charter
   - Safety review frequency
   - Stopping rules
   - Dose modification criteria

3. **Laboratory Monitoring**:
   - Required safety labs
   - Testing schedule
   - Alert values
   - Result reporting timelines

Population Section (Priority: Medium)

markdownCopy# Current Issues:
- Could be more specific on criteria
- Missing demographic requirements
- Lacks detail on screening procedures

# Suggested Enhancement:
Define Population including:

1. **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Specific age ranges
   - Laboratory value requirements
   - Prior therapy restrictions
   - Concomitant medication rules

2. **Screening Procedures**:
   - Required documentation
   - Timing of assessments
   - Re-screening policies
   - Screen failure handling
Implementation Recommendations

Add Section Cross-References

markdownCopyEach section should reference related sections:
- Statistical section should reference endpoints
- Safety should reference study design
- Population should reference procedures
