## Study-Specific Section Prompts

### Phase 1 Studies

#### Safety and Dose-Finding Sections
```
Think through the following sequence:

1. Consider dose escalation plan:
   - What is the starting dose and rationale?
   - What are the dose increments?
   - What safety data will inform escalation?

2. Plan safety monitoring:
   - What are the critical safety parameters?
   - How frequently should they be measured?
   - What are the stopping criteria?

3. Define cohort management:
   - How many subjects per cohort?
   - What is the observation period?
   - When can next cohort start?

Then generate detailed sections addressing each element.
```

### Phase 2 Studies

#### Efficacy Assessment Section
```
Think through:

1. Endpoint selection:
   - Is the endpoint clinically relevant?
   - Can it be measured reliably?
   - Is it sensitive to change?

2. Assessment plan:
   - What are the key timepoints?
   - How to ensure standardization?
   - What quality controls are needed?

3. Data collection strategy:
   - What tools/instruments are needed?
   - How to minimize missing data?
   - How to ensure data quality?

Then create detailed procedures addressing each aspect.
```

### Phase 3 Studies

#### Statistical Analysis Plan
```
Develop the analysis plan through this sequence:

1. Primary Analysis Strategy
   Think through:
   - What is the estimand of interest?
   - What are the key assumptions?
   - What methods best address the hypothesis?

2. Missing Data Approach
   Consider:
   - What patterns of missing data are expected?
   - What are the implications for bias?
   - What methods will handle missing data?

3. Sensitivity Analyses
   Plan:
   - What assumptions need testing?
   - What alternative methods to use?
   - How to present results?

4. Interim Analyses
   Define:
   - When should they occur?
   - What decisions will they inform?
   - How to control overall alpha?

Then generate a comprehensive SAP addressing each element.
```

### Systematic Literature Review

#### Search Strategy Section
```
Design the search strategy by:

1. Question Formulation
   Think through:
   - What are the PICO elements?
   - Any specific study design requirements?
   - Time period considerations?

2. Search Components
   Plan:
   - Which databases to search?
   - What are the key search terms?
   - How to capture all relevant terms?

3. Quality Control
   Consider:
   - How to validate search strategy?
   - What documentation is needed?
   - How to handle updates?

Generate detailed search procedures based on this analysis.
```

### Secondary RWE Studies

#### Data Source and Variables Section
```
Think through data requirements:

1. Data Source Assessment
   Consider:
   - What variables are needed?
   - Are they reliably captured?
   - What is the data quality?

2. Variable Definition
   Plan:
   - How to define each variable?
   - What validation is needed?
   - How to handle missing data?

3. Quality Control
   Define:
   - What checks are needed?
   - How to validate definitions?
   - What documentation required?

Create detailed specifications based on this analysis.
```

## Assessment Schedule Development
```
For any study requiring detailed visit schedules:

1. Timeline Planning
   Think through:
   - What is the minimum follow-up needed?
   - What are the critical timepoints?
   - How to minimize burden?

2. Assessment Selection
   Consider:
   - What data is needed at each visit?
   - Are the timings appropriate?
   - How to handle missing visits?

3. Practical Implementation
   Plan:
   - Visit windows
   - Order of procedures
   - Time requirements

4. Quality Control
   Define:
   - How to ensure completion?
   - What documentation needed?
   - How to monitor compliance?

Then create detailed schedule showing:
- Visit timing and windows
- Required procedures
- Data collection
- Quality measures
```

## Quality Control Section
```
For all study types, think through:

1. Critical Quality Elements
   - What are the key quality risks?
   - Which processes need monitoring?
   - What standards apply?

2. Monitoring Strategy
   - What level of monitoring needed?
   - How to detect issues early?
   - What triggers corrective action?

3. Documentation Requirements
   - What needs documenting?
   - How to ensure completeness?
